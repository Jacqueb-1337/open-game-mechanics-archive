## Mechanic name
Collecting Coins for Extra Lives/Score

## Description
Players collect scattered coins in the game environment to increase their score and gain extra lives. Coins are typically represented as small collectible objects (often yellow/golden) that disappear upon collection. The mechanic includes:

- Coin spawning and placement in the environment
- Collision detection for collecting coins
- Score increment (+1 per coin)
- Lives increment (typically every 10 coins)
- Visual feedback and UI updates
- Optional random respawning to maintain gameplay

## Appearances
- **Donkey Kong** (1981, Nintendo arcade) - First major use of coin collection for scoring
- **Super Mario Bros.** (1985, Nintendo NES) - Popularized coin collection for extra lives and 1-up bonuses
- **Sonic the Hedgehog** (1991, Sega Genesis) - Ring collection system (similar mechanic)
- **The Legend of Zelda** (1986, Nintendo NES) - Rupee collection
- **Pac-Man** (1980, Namco) - Pellet/dots collection for scoring
- **Various platformers** (1980s-1990s) - Standard mechanic in genre
