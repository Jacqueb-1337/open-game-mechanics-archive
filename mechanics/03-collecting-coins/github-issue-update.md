# ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Collecting Coins for Extra Lives/Score

## Mechanic Details

**Name:** Collecting Coins for Extra Lives/Score  
**Description:** Players collect scattered coins in the game environment to increase their score and gain extra lives. This fundamental platformer mechanic involves coin spawning, collision detection, and UI feedback systems.

## Implementation Features
- ‚úÖ **Coin Objects:** Yellow cubes randomly placed in 3D space
- ‚úÖ **Collection System:** Collision detection removes coins on contact
- ‚úÖ **Scoring:** +1 point per coin collected
- ‚úÖ **Lives System:** +1 extra life every 10 coins collected
- ‚úÖ **Random Spawning:** Maintains minimum 5 coins on the map
- ‚úÖ **Visual Feedback:** Green +1 indicators for score/lives changes
- ‚úÖ **UI Display:** Real-time score and lives counters
- ‚úÖ **Controls:** WASD/Arrow keys for movement, Space for jumping

## Technical Specifications
- **Framework:** Three.js WebGL
- **Collision:** Bounding box intersection detection
- **Rendering:** Real-time 3D graphics
- **Input:** Keyboard controls (accessible)
- **Performance:** Optimized for 60 FPS

## Historical Context
- **Earliest Use:** Donkey Kong (1981) - coin collection for scoring
- **Popularization:** Super Mario Bros. (1985) - coin collection for extra lives
- **Patent Status:** Prior art - fundamental mechanic predating modern patents
